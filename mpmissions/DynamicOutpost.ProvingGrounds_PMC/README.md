## Briefing

37th checkpoint 'Bunker' is defended by about 40 soldiers from the 88th Aeromobile Brigade. Following the Minsk Truce, the ringleaders of the pro-Russian armed groups assured that they would not open the fire and agreed to build their own base. Your order: deliver supplies and personnel to the 37th checkpoint and reinforce the military presence in the region.
