*UnfinishedBusiness* is a dynamic and random survival multiplayer mission with PvP elements for 1-20 players. 

Well, wat?

Let me explain :)

You are starting as one coop group and will try to acomplish the mission. This group will be the main story line for the entire mission. If the group will be eliminated, the mission will end immediately.

Players who will endup being killed however are not just supposed to watch and wait. They will be assigened to a different fractions and will be helping or resisting the main group.

The more players are involved in the mission -- the more fun you will get.
